## üöÄ What It Does

CodeVeritas creates **cryptographic proof** that your code is secure before deployment:

1. **AI Analysis** - Scans commits for malicious patterns, vulnerabilities, policy violations
2. **Risk Scoring** - Assigns confidence scores based on multiple security factors  
3. **Blockchain Attestation** - Records immutable proof of analysis on Ethereum
4. **Deployment Gates** - Blocks risky code from reaching production
